# Boolean String Bank - Industries

The Boolean String Bank website(https://scoperac.com/booleanstringbank/) allows members free access to a collection of strings to which they are free to add.
Meanwhile, this Github repository contains strings from the Booelan String Bank that are manually uploaded as often as possible and are accessible to anyone regardless of BSB membership.

The industry lists are in CSV formats and contains tow columns - Strings and Description.

The keyword arrangements in Boolean Strings are useful for offering search insights, including dynamic keyword recommendation systems
(see the Boolean String Bank Workspace: https://scoperac.com/booleanstringbank/#workspace).

Now the datasets are accessible to developers, researchers and other curious minds who are eager to explore and build together.

Let's get started!
